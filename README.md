# Mobile Flashcard App

Let's be honest.

Studying is BORING.

YOU'RE BORING. This mobile flashcard app is also boring! It's a perfect match!

When you're completely dead inside from hours of reading and you're ready to test your wits against something as dead as you are, give this flashcard app a run.

## Getting Things Up and Running
This is just student project for Udacity's React Nanodegree and not a live app, so there's some extra work to be done before you can get this running.

### Option 1 - Running from the Expo Project Using the Expo App on a Real Mobile Device
If you're lazy and web inclined, you can download the Expo mobile app through your favorite App Store (Google Play, Apple App Store), then go to the expo project at https://snack.expo.io/@arcanekit/jealous-churros

Click the "Run" button in the top bar. If you're on an Android device, you'll be able to scan the QR code directly from the Expo app to open the project on your phone. If you're unluckily on iOS, you'll need another QR scanning app to open the project up. 

### Option 2 - Running the Code Locally and Testing on A Browser, Emulator, or Real Mobile Device
If you want the full, boundless developer experience, open this project up in your terminal of choice and run

`yarn install`
`yarn start`

This will open up the app in Expo DevTools, allowing you to choose between running the project on the web, in an Android emulator, or sending a link to your phone with email.

## Using the Flashcard App
Now that you've made it onto the actual app, you'll see some very basic flashcard functionaliity is available.

The home screen will display all of the decks you've created for studying. Your boundless ignorance will confront you every time you open this app.

There are a couple of example decks pre-loaded with sample questions you can explore to get familiar with how the quizzing functionality works.

The tab navigator at the bottom of the screen allows you to add new decks to the home screen.

Once you've added your decks, you can click into any deck from the home screen to add new cards to a deck, or start quizzing on the existing cards.
Take a stab at answering the question on the card, then show the answer and mark your accuracy as you go. You will be provided with a rounded percentage score and number breakdown of your results once you're complete.

If you don't try to test yourself for over a day, there will be a friendly notification sent to your phone to help remind you and keep track.

This app has gone through basic functional testing on Android/iOS/web, using iPhone 11 and Oppo R17 devices. Alas, the mobile world is wide. If you notice any bugs, feel free to raise them.
